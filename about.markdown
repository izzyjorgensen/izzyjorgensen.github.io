I'm from southern California and grew up driving all around the western United States with my family but also travelling abroad and seeing famous salt pans, like the one in Etosha National Park, Namibia. Through my parents, I developed a deep appreciation for history and natural sciences and thus began a career of using diverse data to understand the systemic challenges facing these remote and extreme environments. 

In 2015, I began my undergraduate degree in a very opposite climate: Dublin, Ireland. I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 2019 ranked first in the School of Natural Sciences, winning the prestigious Gold Medal Award from the University and being named Ireland's Undergraduate of the Year by the Environmental Sciences Association of Ireland.

During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant for Dr. Dustin Garrick at the University of Oxford researching rural-to-urban water reallocations around the world. This experience would lead me to an MSc at the University of Oxford in Water Science, Policy and Management and then a World Bank contract writing a background paper for their flagship report on institutional solutions to water scarcity in the Middle East and North Africa, all amid Covid-19 lockdowns.

Shortly thereafter, I followed my advisor to the University of Waterloo to undertake my PhD in Social and Ecological Sustainability, inspired by my department's social-ecological systems research and university's reputation for innovation. I submitted my dissertation in July and defend this coming September, meaning I am on the job market so get in touch!
